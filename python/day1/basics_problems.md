## 📝 PROBLEM 1 – Add Two Numbers (Solve-Me-First Clone)
**Difficulty :** ⭐ Very Easy  
**Estimated time :** 5 min

### Statement
Write a program that reads **two integers** A and B (one per line) and prints their **sum**.

### Input
Two lines – each line contains one integer.

### Output
Single line – the sum `A + B`.

### Sample
```
Input
3
4

Output
7
```

## 📝 PROBLEM 2 – Difference of Two Numbers
**Difficulty :** ⭐ Very Easy  
**Estimated time :** 5 min

### Statement
Read two integers and print the **absolute difference** between them.

### Input
Two lines – each line contains one integer.

### Output
Absolute difference of the two integers.

### Sample
```
Input
10
4

Output
6
```

## 📝 PROBLEM 3 – Circle Measurements
**Difficulty :** ⭐⭐ Easy  
**Estimated time :** 10 min

### Statement
Given the **radius R** of a circle, calculate and print:
1. **Area** of the circle (πR²)  
2. **Circumference** of the circle (2πR)

Use **π = 3.14159**. Output each value on its own line.

### Input
Single line containing a floating-point number R.

### Output
Two lines:
1. Area (rounded to two decimals)  
2. Circumference (rounded to two decimals)

### Sample
```
Input
5

Output
78.54
31.42
```

_Hint:_ Use `round(value, 2)` or formatted strings `f"{value:.2f}"`.

## 📝 PROBLEM 4 – Temperature Converter
**Difficulty :** ⭐⭐ Easy  
**Estimated time :** 10 min

### Statement
Convert a temperature from **Celsius to Fahrenheit** and **Kelvin**.

### Input
One line containing temperature **C** in Celsius (float).

### Output
Two lines:
1. Temperature in Fahrenheit (`F = C × 9/5 + 32`)  
2. Temperature in Kelvin (`K = C + 273.15`)

Each value rounded to **1 decimal place**.

### Sample
```
Input
25

Output
77.0
298.1
```

## 📝 PROBLEM 5 – Simple Interest Calculator
**Difficulty :** ⭐⭐ Easy  
**Estimated time :** 15 min

### Statement
Calculate the **Simple Interest** earned on a principal amount.

Formula → **SI = (P × R × T) / 100**

### Input
Three lines:
1. `P` – Principal amount (float)
2. `R` – Annual interest rate in percent (float)
3. `T` – Time in years (float)

### Output
Single line – Simple Interest rounded to 2 decimals.

### Sample
```
Input
1200
5
2

Output
120.00
```
